### Name Explanation

Imagine that a 3d cube multiply by itself two timesâ€” That's it!

## Installation

```sh
npm i cubecubed --save
```

## Quick Start

See this [Quick Start](https://imaphatduc.github.io/cubecubed/#/quickstart) page.

## Documentation

Documentation website is [here](https://imaphatduc.github.io/cubecubed). (finally!)

## Credits

Cubecubed is built on top of [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3), a marvelous data visualization library, using its powerful SVG manipulation system, along with some [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)'s animation concepts.

## Inspiration

Cubecubed is deeply inspired by [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) - _an animation engine for explanatory math videos_, as described on its GitHub repo.

## Contributing

Cubecubed is currently just a work in progress. Any contribution is appreciated.

## TODO

-   [ ] Input & error handling.
-   [x] Use [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) for rendering math text.
-   [x] Implement sleep method (apply sleep times between animations).
-   [ ] Write a documentation page.
-   [x] Vector visualization.
-   [ ] Matrix transformation.
-   [ ] Create 3d scene (a.k.a. projecting 3d scene into 2d SVG canvas).
-   [x] A way to let the users customize animation time
